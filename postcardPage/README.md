Simple 4Geeks Academy starter project

This is a minimal first project for the 4Geeks Academy bootcamp. It contains only basic HTML and CSS to build a postcard-style page.

Files:
- `index.html` — page markup (HTML)
- `styles.css` — styling (CSS)

That's it — no build tools or dependencies. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the postcard.
